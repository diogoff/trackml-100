# TrackML 100<sup>th</sup> place

This repository contains the solution that ranked #100 in the private leaderboard of the [TrackML competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification).

100<sup>th</sup> place?? Why should anyone care? Apparently, [someone does](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trackml-particle-identification/discussion/69981#433908), as this solution appeared to be the odd one out in a [post-competition analysis](https://twitter.com/trackmllhc/status/1070339064094736390).
